I was skeptical about TypeScript at first. Now I can't imagine writing JavaScript without it.

## The Before Times

```javascript
function getUser(id) {
  // What does this return?
  // What type is id?
  // What happens if user isn't found?
}
```

## The TypeScript Way

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function getUser(id: number): User | null {
  // Now everything is explicit
}
```

## Benefits I've Experienced

1. **Catches errors at compile time** - Not runtime
2. **Better IDE support** - Autocomplete that actually works
3. **Self-documenting code** - Types are documentation
4. **Safer refactoring** - The compiler tells you what broke

## The Learning Curve

Yes, there's overhead. But after a week or two, you'll wonder how you lived without it.

TypeScript isn't about adding complexity—it's about **revealing** complexity that was always there.
