After years of using Git, these commands have become second nature.

## The Essentials

```bash
# See what's changed
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit
git add -p  # Interactive staging
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Sync with remote
git pull --rebase
git push
```

## Undoing Mistakes

```bash
# Unstage files
git reset HEAD file.js

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard local changes
git checkout -- file.js
```

## Pro Tips

- Use `git stash` liberally
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Rebase before merging feature branches
- Use `.gitignore` from the start

These commands cover 95% of my daily Git usage.
