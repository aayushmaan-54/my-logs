Clean code isn't about being clever—it's about being **clear**.

## The KISS Principle

Keep It Simple, Stupid. The simplest solution is often the best solution.

## Meaningful Names

```typescript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const x = users.filter(u => u.a > 18);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const adultUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 18);
```

## Single Responsibility

Each function should do one thing and do it well. If you can't describe what a function does without using "and", it's doing too much.

## Small Functions

If a function is longer than 20-30 lines, consider breaking it apart. Your future self will thank you.

Remember: **Code is read far more often than it is written.**
