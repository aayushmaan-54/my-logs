Both Grid and Flexbox are powerful, but they solve different problems.

## The Quick Answer

- **Flexbox** = One-dimensional layouts (row OR column)
- **Grid** = Two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)

## When to Use Flexbox

```css
/* Navigation bars */
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Centering content */
.center-me {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## When to Use Grid

```css
/* Page layouts */
.page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

/* Card grids */
.cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## Can They Work Together?

Absolutely! Use Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for component internals. They complement each other perfectly.

Don't think of it as Grid **vs** Flexbox. Think of it as Grid **and** Flexbox.
