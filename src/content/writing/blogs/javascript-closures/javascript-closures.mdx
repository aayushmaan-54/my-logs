Closures are one of the most powerful features in JavaScript. They allow functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function references variables from the outer function's scope.

```javascript
function outer() {
  const message = "Hello from closure!";

  return function inner() {
    console.log(message);
  };
}

const greet = outer();
greet(); // "Hello from closure!"
```

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Data Privacy** - Creating private variables
2. **Function Factories** - Creating specialized functions
3. **Event Handlers** - Preserving state in callbacks

Closures are everywhere in JavaScript—once you understand them, you'll see them in every codebase.
