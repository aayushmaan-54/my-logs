The fastest way to learn is to **teach**.

Start a blog. Write about what you're learning.
You'll be wrong sometimes. That's okay.

Benefits:
- Solidifies your understanding
- Creates a personal reference
- Helps others on the same journey
- Builds your reputation

You don't need to be an expert.
Just be one step ahead.
