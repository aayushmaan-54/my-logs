title: 'Why I Prefer Boring Software'

I've slowly learned that **boring software is a feature**, not a flaw.

Boring means:

- fewer surprises
- easier debugging
- less mental overhead

The moment a tool requires me to _remember tricks_, it stops serving me.

I'd rather write:

`for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)`

than something clever I'll forget in six months.
This applies beyond code:

- simple file structures
- predictable URLs
- plain markdown
- minimal UI

Complexity is easy to add later.
Clarity is hard to recover once lost.

If a system feels calm to return to after weeks away,
it's probably designed well.

That's the bar I care about.
