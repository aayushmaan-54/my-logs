Ever wondered why many websites add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to their external links? Let's dive into the reasons behind this practice and why it's essential for web security.

When you create a link that opens in a new tab using `target="_blank"`, the new page has access to the original page's `window` object through `window.opener`. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as:
- `window.opener.location = "https://phishing-site.com";`, which can redirect the original page to a malicious site without the user's consent. This is known as a **tabnabbing attack**.
- The new page can manipulate the original page's content, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious activities.
- When we click on external links, the browser automatically sends the `Referer` header, which contains the URL of the original page. This can inadvertently expose sensitive information to third-party sites, like if url contains user-specific data or session tokens.

To mitigate these risks, adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to your links is a best practice:

## What ``rel="noopener"`` does
It cuts the connection between the original page and the new page, preventing the new page from accessing the `window.opener` property. This means that the new page cannot manipulate.

## What about ``rel="noreferrer"``?
It does two things:
- Prevents sending the `Referer` header when navigating to the new page, which can help protect user privacy.
- Also includes the functionality of `noopener` in modern browsers, ensuring that the new page cannot access the `window.opener` property.
