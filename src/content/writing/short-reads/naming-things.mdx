There are only two hard things in computer science:

1. Cache invalidation
2. Naming things
3. Off-by-one errors

Jokes aside, I spend more time naming variables than I'd like to admit.

A good name should:
- Describe what it holds, not how it's used
- Be searchable
- Avoid abbreviations

`userList` beats `ul` every time.
