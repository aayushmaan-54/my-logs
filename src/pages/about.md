## Why this site exists

This isn't for you. Well, not primarily.
I needed a place to write things down before they vanished from my head. Thoughts, half-baked ideas, things I'm figuring out as I go.
If something here helps you, cool. If not, also cool.
This is mostly for me to think out loud.

You'll find:

- random thoughts
- things I learned the hard way
- ideas that aren't fully formed yet
- whatever's on my mind

No theme. No niche. Just whatever I feel like writing about.

## How to read this

However you want.
Skim. Read deeply. Leave halfway through. I don't care.
There's no posting schedule, no email list, nothing to keep up with.
If one post makes you think differently about something, that's more than enough.

## About me

I'm **Aayushmaan Soni**.
I build web stuff. Full-stack technically, but I prefer backend. I do frontend too, mostly with AI's help (probably more than I should).
I like building things, watching them break, then figuring out _why_ they broke.
I care more about understanding things deeply than doing them quickly.
Nothing here is set in stone. I change my mind. That's fine.
